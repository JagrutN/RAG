#RAG Pipeline for Health Data.

You can install all the dependencies using the following script
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
In the data folder you can include your medical documents. Here I have just kept random documents in it.

Once the code runs all your logs will be in log directory.

So further in this I have recently added aganetic RAG code. You can check out the fucntion def create_agentic_graph() to look how it is implemented.
